                                        It is really difficult to do justice by written word to the life of any great
                                        saint. As a matter of fact, his greatness defies any description. As such, the
                                        subject is beyond the limits of spoken or written word. However, in order to
                                        quench the thirst of the anxious millions, an attempt has been made, hereby, to
                                        throw some light on the salient features of the benevolent life of Shri Guru
                                        Dev.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The personal magnetism of Swamiji was the symbol of eternal peace described by
                                        the saints as the embodiment of Tapasya and spiritual enlightenment. When
                                        Swamiji was enthroned as Shankaracharya his natural grandeur was matchless. His
                                        face radiated natural softness, simplicity, purity and calmness. In everyday
                                        life, his renunciation was evident. Every word uttered by him had wonderful
                                        magnetic power which made a great and deep impression on the hearts of the
                                        listeners. Everyone who came in contact with Shri Guru Dev thought that he was
                                        the most beloved of Shri Guru Dev. This was a strange experience of everyone.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Shri Guru Dev himself gave little advice. When anyone asked a question, he used
                                        to answer in a manner which solved many psychological problems of all the
                                        persons sitting there. Every listener wondered how he got the reply to his
                                        question without putting his particular question.</p>
                                    <p>In his preachings, Shri Guru Dev most often dwelt upon his own experiences and
                                        for this reason his words always carried a novelty of his own experiences and
                                        people were always anxious to hear him. This has helped us in recording the
                                        events of his life, which have proved to be the guiding source and inspiration
                                        to his lovers and devotees all over the world. In this book, an effort has been
                                        made to describe those very events, which were heard by his admirers and
                                        followers.</p>
                                    <p>I belive this collection will help to give a glimpse of Swami jiâ€™s greatness and
                                        his benign soul, which was like a flower of a matchless colour and fragrance.
                                        Besides, this book will fulfil the long felt need of his followers admirers who
                                        longed for such a book on Shri Guru Devâ€™s life.</p>
                                    <p>It is regretted that the book could not be produced to my best satisfaction, and
                                        unfortunately, contains quite a large number of proof mistakes. I owe an apology
                                        for those errors and other short comings of this publication to my dear readers
                                        and crave for their indulgence to ignore the same.</p>

                                    <p>As I have been one of those who never had the good fortune and divine privilege
                                        of having a glimps of such a greaet Indian saint as Swami Brahmanandji Saraswati
                                        though he lived during my life time itself. Iam, naturally,in no way a fit
                                        person for writing the introduction to this book whose author Dr. Rajrajeshwari
                                        Prasad Varma is himself a saint in his own way, and had the good fortune of not
                                        only knowing our Guru Dev for a pretty long period but had actually been
                                        initiated in the realm of â€œ Dhyan-yoga" by Guru Dev himself.</p>
                                    <p>One might wonder that how could I address Swami Brahmanand ji Saraswati as my
                                        Guru Dev, i.e, my spiritual teacher, when, what to say of being initiated by
                                        him. I had even never seen him. I feel, I owe an explanation for it to the
                                        readers.</p>
                                    <p>I have been working journalist since the beginning of my career in 1944, and till
                                        the end of sixties my occupation kept me so busy that I never thought of God.
                                        Spiritualism had absolutely no place in my day-to-day life. In the beginning of
                                        1967 when I get a bolt from the blue in suddenly loosing my job as editor of a
                                        daily newspaper and suffered huge financial losses, I got totally upset and
                                        began seeking solace in spiritualism. Though things began to take a favourable
                                        turn after a few years of struggle, somehow or the other, my search for peace of
                                        mind through spiritual pursuits continued. But the more eagerly I sought it, the
                                        more elusory it proved to be.</p>
                                    <p>By 1974 my enthusiasm for spiritualism had got much dampened and so, naturally,
                                        when someone tried to sell T.M. ( the technique of transcendental meditation
                                        taught by Maherishi Mahesh Yogi, one of the foremost disciples of Guru Dev,
                                        through a network of initiators and meditation centres round the world ) to me,
                                        I gave a cold shoulder to it. Two years later, I suddenly found my wife Uma
                                        khare and some of my groun-up children only discussing T. M. , but actually
                                        practicing it. They suggested again and again that I also learn it, but I
                                        brushed aside the idea. My wife got much interested in T.M. that she herself
                                        became an initiator after undergoing a training for about nine months at a
                                        distant hill-station. Needless to say that she did it against my wishes. But I
                                        almost miraculous happenings began to take place in my family, particularly
                                        concerning those who had taken to the practice of T. M. I regret, I wonâ€™t be
                                        able to narrate those happenings here because of shortage of space, but they mad
                                        me inquisitive about T.M. On being repeatedly told that one can really know
                                        about T.M. only by learning and practicing it. I have up my resistance and
                                        learnt it.</p>
                                    <p>The initiation took place in front of a picture of Guru Dev and I was told that I
                                        should consider neither my initiator nor Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as my spiritual
                                        teacher but the Guru Dev himself. It was a thrilling experience and the very
                                        first day my turbulent mind experienced such a serene calm that when I got up
                                        after practicing T.M. for the first time, I bowed my head to the lotus feet of
                                        Guru Dev and since that day have regarded him us my spiritual teacher and guide.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>As you know, the journalists are very inquisitive, by nature as well as training.
                                        So, I was soon all out in search of such books that could throw light on the
                                        life of Guru Dev, my teache, about whom I knew almost nothing after years of
                                        efforts. I could lay hand on only one such book, but it failed to satisfy my
                                        inquisitivness. And then, when one fine morning I came to now that Dr. Varma a
                                        direct disciple of Guru Dev-has come to Jaipur and will be staying in thin town
                                        for a few years to get the statues of Guru Dev and other saints of the Holy
                                        Tradition manufactured I decided to meet him as often as possible and learn from
                                        him about the life and teachings of my great teacher.</p>
                                    <p>Since then I have had the privilege of a number of meetings with Dr. Varma , and
                                        whenever I asked him to tell us some thing about our Guru dev, I found in him an
                                        enthusiastic talker. He would go on talking about Guru Dev for hours at a
                                        stretch, never showing the least sign of fatigue, though he is running his
                                        eightees. He carries with him a store-house of reminiscences and, with his
                                        unassuming nature and unraffled calmness on his face, is always willing to share
                                        with one and all whatever he knows about or has learnt from, our Guru Dev. This
                                        book is the result of his inner urge to share his experiences with others. While
                                        listening to his reminiscences about our Guru Dev. I always felt that the he
                                        should pen it down for the benefit of all the seekers of truth, and my joy knew
                                        no founds when I learnt that he has actually done it. And, when he asked me to
                                        write a short introduction to this book, I considered it to be a privilege and
                                        favour that I never deserved.</p>
                                    <p>This book is in the form of a biography and contains only some selected
                                        reminiscences of the author. Though the volume of the book is very short and it
                                        has been produced in great haste, without proper editing and correction of proof
                                        mistakes, the efforts of the author are highly commendable for it is through

                                <h3>1. Childhood And Sanyas</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>Swamiji (Shri Guru Dev) was born on 21st december, 1870 (Thursday), Vikram Samvat
                                        1928, Marg Shirsh Shukla Dasmi, at Surhurpur, district Faizabad in uttar Pradesh
                                        (india) in a renowned and rich Saryupani Brahmin family. At that time nobody
                                        knew that the child born with a silver spoon in his mouth will be a great
                                        renouncer of worldly life and will adorn the Throne of great Jagatguru Shri
                                        Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath in the Himalayas.</p>
                                    <p>Shri Guru Devâ€™s early life was very mysterious and noble, In his childhood, he
                                        became conscious of the transitoriness of worldly life and things. In his
                                        everyday life he was fond of loneliness and non-attachment to physical word. He
                                        was often seen in a serious mood and meditation. There were no signs of childish
                                        mirth and he had no liking for delicious dishes. Costly and attractive clothes
                                        did not attract him. He had no interested in playthings of children. He was
                                        always in thoughtful mood. The seriousness of his everyday work and his
                                        mysterious ways of conversation surprised his family members. He was a profound
                                        thinker, of firm mind and unshakable decisive nature, even at his early age. He
                                        was very dear to his grandfather and as such as was much attached to him. He was
                                        with him almost throughout the day. Shri Guru Dev also had great love for his
                                        grandfather, who died after attaining the age of 100 yeas when Shri Guru Dev was
                                        only 7 years of age. Though his family members tried their utmost to hide the
                                        disposal of the dead body from the child but at last Shri Guru Dev saw the
                                        corpse of his grandfather being taken away and he also heard the persons
                                        repeating the eternal words " Ram Nam Sat Hae " i.e. " only the Name Of Ram is
                                        True â€œ. This event caused two uppermost deep impressions on the mind of the
                                        little child, viz :</p>
                                    <p>First Impressionâ€”His grandfather will be seen no more.</p>
                                    <p>Second Impressionâ€“God is Supreme.</p>
                                    <p>At the tender age pf seven years he realized that like his grandfather, all his
                                        relatives and he himself will pass away one day. As time passed on, Swamiji
                                        (Shri Guru Dev) began to think more and more about â€˜RAMAâ€™ and its meanings. By
                                        and by, he was convinced that the name of God is the only substantial and
                                        eternal things in this world. At the age of eight his parents, as is usual among
                                        the Brahmins, decided to perform the Sacred Thread Ceremony and thereafter sent
                                        the boy of studies to Banaras, (VARANSI) the seat of learning. Which may perhaps
                                        help boy to his grandfather.</p>

                                <h3>2. Left Home In Search Of Spiritual Guru</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>The boy was brought home. Every member of the family was joyful. But the boy all
                                        the time talked of Gyan and Vairagya (Supreme knowledge and Renunciation to all
                                        the elders and the aged in the family. All of them considered his talk to be a
                                        whim of his childhood and did not pay any attention to it.</p>
                                    <p>He repeatedly requested them not to entangle him in a family life, but they all
                                        tried their utmost to get him round to lead a family life. Even though they all
                                        knew very well that the boy was adopting the most pious course beneficial not
                                        only to himself but to the whole family, rather to the whole world, they tried
                                        to dissuade him on account of their love for him. Imagining the hardships of the
                                        life of a recluse, and renouncing the world they feared much more. They tried
                                        their best to change the boyâ€™s views but all in vain they very well knew the no
                                        achievement is possible, Worldly or Divine, without realizing the Absolute and
                                        the knowledge of Supreme Wisdom.</p>
                                    <p>After all, they called the aged, learned and experienced Guru of the family to
                                        get the thoughts of the boy changed. The learned Guru had full confidence that
                                        he would be successful. But, howsoever, intellectually the Guru argued with
                                        higher standard of intelligence. When the Guru failed to convince the boy, the
                                        Guru began to instruct the boy emotionally pointing out the family traditions, â€œ
                                        My dear boy, you are the only son of your beloved parents and all their future
                                        hopes and desires are entered on your carrier alone. Do not renounce and render
                                        them help. Less in this old age. To serve them, is your supreme and pious duty.
                                        Their remaining life will be chaotic and painful. You are too young to retire to
                                        jungle and take to hard penances. If at all you have decided to take Sanyas and
                                        practice Yoga or Vairagya, even then your age does not suit it. First you have
                                        to look to your responsibilities concerning your family, lead family life, gain
                                        enough worldly experience and when suitable occasion comes take Sanyas and do
                                        the needful. Whil raw in experience nothing could be achieved."</p>

                                <h3>3. In Utter kashi</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>Once, in Uttarkashi a renowned preacher of Indian Philosophy had come and all the
                                        Sadhus and Mahatmas were invited to hear him. The young Brahmachari, Brahm
                                        Chaitanya (our reversed Guru Dev) never used to go anywhere out of the Ashram of
                                        his Sad Guru. The other Brahmacharies and Aspirants residing in the Ashram
                                        wanted to hear the discourse of this preacher and accordingly, they requested
                                        their Sad Guru to grant them permission. All of them were allowed to go, after
                                        locking the gate of the Ashram from outside and enter the Ashram on their
                                        return, unlocking the gate. All of them went to hear the preacher after locking
                                        the gate. At this moment, the young Brahmachari thought to himself.</p>
                                    <p>â€œIt would be a share waste of time to attend a theoretical unproductive
                                        discourse. Moreover, it would be direct disrespect to you Guru Dev who is a
                                        great Spiritual Guide. Knower of Truth, Glorious Tapasvi and Siddha Yogi, whose
                                        kind guidance will enlighten me to self realization. Where and why to go leaving
                                        His Lotus Feet at which I have dedicated my Self ? What benefit one could gain
                                        by hearing discourse from a preacher who has bookish knowledge only ? Nothing
                                        could compensate the great insult to Shri Sad Guru who has been locked inside
                                        the Ashram and all have come out- a shame-ful action".</p>
                                    <p>Every step onward strengthened this thought of the Bal Tapasvi. At last he
                                        finally decided, â€œIf they to, let them to, but I will not go and will return to
                                        the Ashram. But for this action and to get the key from the elderly Brahmachari
                                        there must be some reason to accomplish the end in view."</p>
                                    <p>So he politely spoke to the senior Brahmachari, â€œAs many highly learned Pundits
                                        of Uttar Kashi would attend the discourse of the preacher while I wonâ€™t be able
                                        to grasp anything from the speech, so my presence there would be of no avail.
                                        Please let me have the key of the gate. I shall go back to the Ashram."</p>
                                    <p>He took the key and was going back. On the way, he noticed that two Dandi
                                        Sanyasies were also going towards Shri Guru Ashram. He hurriedly reached the
                                        gate and opened if for them. He escorted them to his room, offered seats to them
                                        and enquired if they had taken Bhiksha (FOOD). They replied that for Bhiksha,
                                        they had come there and after that they would go to hear the discourse. He then
                                        prepared Halwa (Indian sweet preparation with wheat flour, sugar ate Halwa and
                                        went to attend the discourse. After this Brahmachari Brahm Chaitanya sat down to
                                        meditate.</p>
                                    <p>In the evening, after the discourse was over, all the persons came back in the
                                        Ashram along with the two Dandi Sanyasies, who later met Shri Guru Dev. Shri
                                        Guru Dev enquired from them if they had taken Bhiksha. They replied, â€œYes,
                                        Maharaj ji, we had taken Halwa here in the Ashram and then we had gone to attend
                                        the discourse".</p>

                                <h3>4. Some Amazing Events</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>Shri Maharaj Shri (our Guru Dev) while living in Uttarkashi, with his Sad Guru
                                        Dev, deligently completed his deep study of the Vedas and the practice of Yoga.
                                        At the age of 25 years, being Atmnishth (self-contained) descended the Himalayas
                                        along with Shri Sad Guru Dev. For some days they stayed in Kajlivan, a jungle
                                        near Rishikesh. This Kajlivan is a dense and solitary jungle wherein fierce wild
                                        animals live. In such a fierce jungle, If any Mahatma could stay for some time,
                                        his reputation spread far and wide, in the villages and naturally people in
                                        crowds rushed up for his Darshan (to see him).</p>
                                    <p>Amongst the visitors a Brahman used to supply 1/2 litre milk to Maharaj Shri
                                        every day and in the night Maharaj Shri used to give warm milk to Sad Guru Dev.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>One day, when the Brahman started with milk from his home, his wife said, â€œToday,
                                        we have less milk and so very little milk will be left for the children." But he
                                        brought the milk as usual and didnâ€™t listen to his wife. Maharaj Shri like the
                                        previous nights, offered milk to his Sad Guru Dev. On looking at the milk, Guru
                                        Dev said, â€œThere is pain mixed today in this milk, so I will not take it. Return
                                        this milk to the man and stop taking milk from him." Maharaj Shri did the same.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>After about two weeks, the Brahmanâ€™s son died and among the villagers a rumour
                                        prevailed that Sad Guru Devâ€™s displeasure is the cause of the childâ€™s death.
                                        Maharaj Shri heard this rumour and brought it to the notice of Guru Dev.</p>
                                    <p>Hearing this Guru Dev said, â€œWhen they take the dead-body for cremation, tell
                                        them not to burnit but they should call me before its disposal." When the
                                        dead-body was brought to the crematiojn ground, they kept it there and Guru Dev
                                        also reached there.</p>
                                    <p>Sad Guru Dev asked the people there to get the funeral cloth removed from the
                                        dead-body. When the cloth was removed Sad Guru Dev touching the head of the
                                        dead-body with his feed said, â€œWhy do you sleep so much ?"</p>

                                        from all over India had assembled there. Maharaj Shri also reached Prayag, which
                                        Shri Sad Guru Dev as well graced the occasion. Maharaj Shri, at such an
                                        auspicious occasion, prayed to Shri Sad Guru Dev, â€œBhagwan, if you think me
                                        worthy, please initiate me as a Sanyasi." Shri Sad Guru Dev considering him
                                        deserving in all respects joyously consented. At the pious spot, the confluence
                                        of three rivers, the holy Ganges, the Yamuna and the Saraswati (invisible), the
                                        rites of Sanyas were performed. A grand religious feast was arranged and all
                                        Brahmacharies. Sadhus and Dandi Swamies were honoured by offering cloths etc.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>By initiating Maharaj Shri at the age of 36, Shri Sad Guru Dev gave him Dand,
                                        Kamandal and Kaupin and named him â€œShri Swami Brahmanand Saraswati Maharaj".</p>
                                    <p>All the Sadhus, Mahatmas and religious people then became anxious to have his
                                        Darshan and Blessings. But Maharaj Shri, as he often liked, used to live in
                                        lonely jungles. If his devotees could know of his stay in a particular jungle,
                                        they rushed there for his Darshan. On holy occasion, if he happened to go to
                                        Holy places like Kashi and Ayodhya, people gathered round him in great numbers
                                        to hear his most precious and inspiring words.</p>
                                    <p>Dandi Swami (Sanyasi), a recluse of the highest order, has to follow a particular
                                        code and rules, which are very hard to observe in his life time. In fact, in the
                                        eyes of a Sanyasi there is no world as such and he has nothing to do with it.
                                        That is why he likes seclusion. As for his Bhiksha (meals), he is allowed once a
                                        day, i.e. at noon time, to go to three houses, at the most, of three different
                                        families. If he gets Bhiksha at the first house well and good, otherwise he
                                        tries second and third house. In case no Bhiksha could be available that day, he
                                        has to pass 24 hours without it. Dandi Sanyasi, by rule, has to stay in a
                                        village or a town for a couple of days only, but in Monsoon season when the
                                        heavy rains are continuous for weeks together, he can stay at one place for two
                                        months called â€œChaturmasa". Thus there are so many restrictions and hard rules
                                        for him to follow strictly.</p>

                                <h3>6. Independent Thought & The World</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>In 1930, Kumbha Mela was to be held in Prayag. The Kumbha mela is a very great
                                        religious congregation held once in 12 years at Prayag and at three other Holy
                                        places in different years in India. The Mela lasts for one full month and people
                                        from all over India come to take bath in the Holy Triveni, the confluence of the
                                        Yamuna, the Holy Ganges and the Saraswati.</p>
                                    <p>So the devotees of Maharaj Shri at Prayag had arranged in advance for his stay
                                        during the Mela period in a spacious building situated in Daraganj area, which
                                        belonged to one of his devotees of Prayag and he was awaiting the arrival of
                                        Maharaj Shri.</p>
                                    <p>Maharaj Shri decided not to go to Prayag, but to stay at a place some 12 miles
                                        away on the bank of the Ganges, in a small room adjoining the Temple of
                                        Kaurweshwar Mahadev (Lord Shiva). At the same time, he thought that one of his
                                        devotees had already arranged for a big house for his stay, which should be used
                                        or else he might feel that his services were not accepted. So Maharaj Shri got
                                        some of his disciples, the Dandi Sanyasies, accommodated in that house for the
                                        time, the Kumbha Mela lasted.</p>
                                    <p>The devotee thinking that maharaj Shri had not come to Prayag to stay in his
                                        house felt disappointed, but when he was informed that Maharaj Shri had
                                        accommodated his disciples, the Dandi Sanyasies, in his house, he was satisfied.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>However, it so happened that a rich friend of the devotee was in Calcutta. He
                                        wrote to his friend, the devotee, in Prayag that his children and relatives in
                                        Calcutta wished to stay in Prayag during Kumbha Mela and earnestly reguested him
                                        to allot his house of Daraganj to his children for their stay there. The devotee
                                        thinking that as Maharaj Shri was not staying in the house, the Dandi Sanyasies
                                        could be shifted to some other place.</p>

                                <h3>7. Maharaj Shriâ€™s Stay at Jabalpur & Dr. Varmaâ€™s Initition</h3>
                                <div>
                                    <p>On 27<sup>th</sup> August 1940, in the morning I had gone to the market. While
                                        returning, on the way I saw two men, who were talking together that a Siddha
                                        Yogi Mahatma had come in our city. The other man asked him, â€œWhat is his name?"
                                        The former said, â€œI do not know his name." The later asked. â€œWhere is he
                                        staying?" The former replied, â€œSome where in Wright Town."</p>
                                    <p>When I heard their talk, I got interested to know more about the Siddha Yogi
                                        Mahatma. I enquired from them the location of the house in Wright Town. One of
                                        them said, â€œI have heard only this much,"</p>
                                    <p>This was a sort of message from Maharaj Shri of his coming to Jabalpur. Just
                                        then, I resolved to have his Darshan, the same day. I thought so because such
                                        Siddha Yogi Mahatmas were very rare to be seen.</p>
                                    <p>At 3 P.M I locked my Studio and started to find Maharaj Shri in Wright Town. The
                                        sun was shining brightly and there was no trace of any cloud on the sky, I was
                                        going at abnormal speed.</p>
                                    <p>Then all of a sudden a call was heard from behind â€œVarma Ji Varma Ji." I stopped,
                                        turned back and saw a man waving his hand for me. I went to him. He said â€œYour
                                        friend Shanker Prasad a Tantrik wants you."</p>

                                <div>
                                    <p>(The Highest Religious Seat Of The North In The Himalayas)<br>INSTALLATION ON THE
                                        THRONE OF JYOTIRMATH</p>
                                    <p>Jyotishpeeth was established by His Divinity the first Shankaracharya, but for
                                        the last 160 years, it was silent. In 1908, in a great religious congregation
                                        many Indian Kings resolved that Jyotishpeeth be renovated as soon as it was
                                        possible and the same was passed unopposed.</p>
                                    <p>Since then in every great religious gathering of Bharat Dharma Mandal. (All India
                                        Religious Board of Directors) renovation of the Jyogishpeeth was discussed and
                                        the question was to find out the fittest personality worthy of installation.</p>
                                    <p>According to the Constitution of Jyotirmath framed by Adi Shankaracharya, the
                                        most suitable Acharya to be installed on the religious. Throne of Jyotishpeeth
                                        must have the following qualifications :â€“ The Acharya should have thorough
                                        knowledge of Vedic Wisdom and he should be a Dandi Sanyasi and a Bal
                                        Brahmachari. He should possess Spiritual Power and Knowledge. Moreover, he
                                        should be Yogi and Siddha Mahatma.</p>
                                    <p>So then, the learned Mahatmas of Bharat Dharma Mahamandal and the most efficient
                                        Acharyas of North India were in search of such a befitting Acharya for
                                        installation. In no time, all agreed and found the ablest and the most qualified
                                        Acharya in Maharaj Shri.</p>
                                    <p>But none dared to approach him with the resolution of renovation of the silent
                                        Jyotishpeeth because of his high austerity and renunciation. His principle had
                                        always been to avoid public contact and to spend his whole time in his prayers
                                        and meditation.</p>

                                            the very heart of the audience. Whosoever happened to be hold. Him once, was
                                            desirious to have His Darshan again and again. Every beholder after His
                                            Darshan, was influenced by His Divinity and began to experience that he was
                                            the most beloved of Maharaj Shri.</li>
                                        <li>The words of Maharaj Shri were simple, sweet and far-reaching, carrying the
                                            real essence of the subject, which is not found elsewhere. Beside this, His
                                            peculiar method was such that during His discourses, problems of the
                                            listeners were automatically solved without any question. His discourses
                                            based on His self experiences were very much effective and interesting. So
                                            the audience used to listen to Him with keen interest and great delight.

                                        <li>His individual self was evidently great and even in His absence His
                                            miraculous power was fairly experienced by His Devotees. When ever His
                                            disciple remembered Him in his difficulty, his trouble vanished that very
                                            moment. Hundreds of disciples told tales of the same, when their
                                            difficulties were over. Several staunch atheists by the Divine influence of
                                            Maharaj Shri became religious minded and believers in God and they proved to

                                            to the photo of Shri Guru Dev in their homes as a mark of respect to him.

                                    <p>After saying for a month at Prayag, Maharaj Shri left for Varanasi enroute to
                                        Calcutta, where the Silver Jubilee of the all India Philosophical Association
                                        was to be celebrated.</p>
                                    <p>Many renowned philosophers of India and abroad assembled to commemorate the
                                        Jubilee. Maharaj Shri presided and delivered his presidential address covering
                                        Indian Philosophy in very simple but heart-touching words.</p>
                                    <p>The renowned philosophers of the world were fascinated when they heard Him. Some
                                        of them were desirous to meet Him in privacy.</p>
                                    <p>The next day at about 10 Oâ€™clock in the night, respected philosopher of India,
                                        late Shri Arvpalli Radhakrishnan with two eminent philosophers from abroad, Dr.
                                        Kanger and Dr. Shilp arrived in the Ashram of Shri Shankaracharya.</p>
                                    <p>Maharaj Shri was relaxing on the open terrace in the third storey in Moon lit
                                        night. Near Him Brahmachari devotee was enjoying Bliss in deep meditation. The
                                        Dwarpal (gate keeper) came and said; â€œBhagwan, with Dr. Radhakrishnan two
                                        philosophers from England and America have arrived for darshan of Maharaj Shri."
                                        The gate keeper stood awaiting the order of Maharaj Shri.<br><br>After a few
                                        moments Maharaj Shri said, â€œWell. Let them come in." <br><br>All the three
                                        philosophers came in, bowed down at Maharaj Shriâ€™s feet and set down on a carpet
                                        before Him. <br><br>After introduction Dr. Radhakrishan prayed to Maharishi Shri
                                        and said" Dr. Kanger wants to hear some thing on Vedant, Philosophy. He wants
                                        some help from Maharaj Shri for self realization." <br><br>Maharaj Shri began,
                                        â€œVedant itself is self evident. It is Light, which needs no other light to be
                                        illuminated." <br><br>Dr. Kanger said respectfully, â€œThose means of realization
                                        which are narrated in Vedant Shastras (Books on Philosophy) can not be called in
                                        vain."</p>
                                    <p>Maharaj Shri continued, â€œThose means are there, not to illuminate the Absolute,
                                        but their object is to vanish ignorance. Means destroy ignorance; they do not
                                        illuminate the Absolute. That which is self illuminated needs no other light to
                                        illumine it. For instance the Sun is self illuminated body: it needs no other
                                        light to illumine it. Before sunrise, Dawn comes, but the Dawn only vanishes the
                                        darkness of night. It does not enlighten the Sun. The Sun is self illuminated.
                                        All the means narrated in Vedant Shastras are simply to get rid of ignorance.
                                        They never enlighten the Absolute, the Atma. The Atma, the Absolute is self
                                        Light and viewer of all."</p>
                                    <p>Hearing the essential exhortation, Dr. Radhakrishnan was over joyed and gave out,
                                        â€œHow explicitly Maharaj Shri has solved such a difficult question. â€œLater, they
                                        begged pardon for troubling Maharaj Shri and reverentially bowed down and left.

                                        citizen of Allahabad within minutes. In the noon time Maharaj Shri had to take
                                        the journey but the gentry began to gather in crowds in Brahm Niwas from 8
                                        Oâ€™clock in the morning to have His Darshan. Brahm Niwas was overcrowded with

                                        of the car to start sooner as He gates in. The car was started, but there was no
                                        room to move on, because of the thick crowd inside and outside Brahm Niwas.</p>
                                    <p>The tearful eyes of the emotional devotees and the people present there melted
                                        the benevolent heart of Maharaj Shri. With great difficulty, His car could move
                                        ahead.</p>
                                    <p>With acclamation of the weeping crowd, His journey commenced. On the way side,

                                    <p>The sincere devotion of the citizens at His Lotus feet cannot be described in
                                        words. The devotees there planned to celebrate Shri Shankaracharya Week so that
                                        the gentry may derive the utmost benefit from the nectarine discourses of

                                    <p>On May 20, 1953, at about One Oâ€™clock, in the afternoon, His Holiness Maharaj
                                        Shri was examined by a renowned Doctor, Shri Vidhan Chandra Roy of Calcutta, who
                                        said that there was nothing wrong in His health, the heart was normal and the
                                        general condition was satisfactory and requested Maharaj Shri to take rest.</p>
                                    <p>Maharaj Shri reposed for about 10 minutes and then sat on the bed and said to

                                        His Holiness said, â€œDue to continous engagements in preaching and the management

                                    <p>Maharaj Shri also directed Mahesh ji, how His body Is to be disposed off after.
                                        He had left it and the due Rites to be performed, thereafter.</p>

                                <div>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>(SAYINGS of Shri Guru Dev, â€œ Vedanta Incarnate", His Divinity Swaim
                                            Brahmanand Saraswati Maharaj, the illustrious Jagadguru Shankracharya,
                                            Jyotirmath, Badrikashram Himalayas). Having become a devotee of God one can
                                            never remain unhappy anywhere. This is our experience.</li>
                                        <li>The â€œJIVA" is going on doing its work from several births. Its tendency to
                                            work exists since times immemorial. Therefore, if the work is just started
                                            with little co-operation of the mind, it shall continue to go on just like
                                            the Wagon moving a long way off, it is just jerked and pushed by Engine.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>It is necessary to bifurcate the work of the mind as main and secondary.
                                            Thinking of God should be considered as main and giving a little
                                            co-operating to carry on VYAVAHARA worldly activities as secondary.</li>
                                        <li>Apply your body and wealth mainly, and your mind secondarily, to run the
                                            VYAVAHARA.</li>
                                        <li>When the mind is mainly engaged in thinking of God, you shall receive His
                                            grace. God is All-powerfull (Sarva Shaktiman). Even a little of His Grace is
                                            capable of bestowing on the JIVA all that is good in its entirety.</li>
                                        <li>The declaration of Lord that is proved by the Vedic Scriptures is this :
                                            â€œWHOSOEVER THINKS OF ME WITH ONEPOINTED DEVOTION, I SHALL CONDUCT HIS
                                            NECESSARY VYAVAHARA (Worldly activities) ALSO". The experience of the
                                            Bhaktas also goes to prove this declaration of the Lord.</li>
                                        <li>Accumulate â€œARTHA" (wealth); but I such a way that it is not against
                                            â€œPARMARTHA" (ultimate good). That which hinders â€œPARMARTHA" and results in
                                            accumulation of Sin is not â€˜Arthaâ€™ but â€˜ Anarthaâ€™ (negation of wealth).</li>
                                        <li>As is the cloth so is the price. For carrying on the short-lived activities
                                            of â€˜VYAVAHARAâ€™, employ your short-lived body and wealth. Mind is a permanent
                                            thing which remains with you always. Even in the other world. It will
                                            continue to stay with you. Therefore, connect it with a permanent thing.
                                            God, being the eternal existence both in animate and inanimate things, is
                                            the only permanent thing of the highest order. Connect your mind with Him.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If the mind is satisfied with wealth, wife or children, why does it go
                                            elsewhere ? Because, it cannot stick on to anything. From this it is clear
                                            it is not satisfied, with anything of this mundane world. It runs after
                                            things taking them to be good and desirable but after a short while it
                                            leaves them.</li>
                                        <li>Nobody wants your mind in the world and mind also is not satisfied with
                                            anything of the world.</li>
                                        <li>The mind is not fit for the world nor or the world for the mind.</li>
                                    </ol>

                            <i>Author of â€œStrange facts about a great Saint" my grandfather Dr. Raj RP Varma and my
                                father Chandra Kishor Varma(Gangesh) is a devotee of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati Maharaj.
                                Following the footsteps of my father and my grand father I moved to Maharishi Nagar,
                                Noida. In there my uncle (tauju) Shree J.P. Shrivastava taught me the practice of
                                Transcendental Meditation in 1991, there I worked at Vedic Vishwa Prashashan. One year
                                later I moved to MVU(Maharishi Vedic University), Vlodrop, Holland.</i>
                            <p>There under Maharishi ji I worked as a translator and help in designing the maps of
                                various states of India from 1992-96. I also do the Data Entry there and involved in
                                Jyothish and Ayurveda Department. My office is just aside of the Maharishi Suit.</p>
                            <p>Remembering, â€œOne day Maharishi ji called me and ask suresh do you know how to operate a
                                computer, I said to them I have never operated the computer before. Then he asked me to
                                draw the maps of various states of India. I got confused and said I have belonged to
                                civil engineering and donâ€™t know how Design maps in a computer. Then he replied that you
                                have to be an omniscient and have to gain knowledge of every field and said you can do
                                it and you will do it within a week, and after one week I have completed the designs of
                                various states of India including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and many other
                                states". He can depict the capability of a person by his face and his that motivation
                                helped me learned various aasanas, dhyan, and siddhi. But as I am the only son of my
                                parents and to help them for their needs, to take care of them I have to move back to
                                Bhopal, India in 1996.</p>
                            <p>I again moved to Delhi on November 11, 2011 and worked at HR department of Maharishi
                                Ayurveda Product, NEPZ, Noida.</p>
                            <p>Currently I working as a photographer and opened a small business (Nandini Enterprises)
                                manufacturing the CFL and LED lights (as said by Maharishiji).</p>
                            <p>I have learned the way of living from Maharishi ji and with his blessings only today I
                                have moved forward in life and continue providing this auspicious book written by my
                                grandfather to make people follow the path of living taught by Swami Brahmanand
                                Saraswati to live happy and successful life.</p>
                            <p>I am also thankful to my cousins Anand Shrivastava, Prakash Shrivastava, and Girish
                                Chandra Varma who helped me in my hard times and are always there to support me in the
